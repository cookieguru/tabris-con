How? PHP and JavaScript. See how using PHP facilitated long-distance teamwork and helped a weak game develop into a better one. PHP \/ MySql enabled the team to easily coordinate updates to playing cards, and with JavaScript, updated board designs could be generated instantly. These methods allowed rapid prototyping and play-testing cycles. And, with this methodology Goal Quest Games will quickly adapt and publish a recently requested custom version. Attendees will learn the value of the rapid prototyping \/ play-testing cycle in game development as well as how to generate board images for print using JavaScript.","type":"talk","presenter":[{"id":7,"fullname":"Marcia Burrows","twitter":"thelogicalwoman","picture":"http:\/\/www.pnwphp.com\/storage\/speakers\/a1216cd9b1196f2d7a1ac9d01f4b9a17.png","bio":"I'm Marcia Burrows.
